Requirements : 
- a unix type system (linux, mac os x) with a c++ compiler (gcc, clang...)
- matlab
- optional : Cuda and the nvcc compiler
- the .bash_profile file must set the variable $PATH so that matlab and mex 
commands are known from a bash terminal. If the nvcc compiler is installed,
the .bash_profile file must also set the $PATH to its location
