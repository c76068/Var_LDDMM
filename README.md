# Var_LDDMM

This is a MATLAB implementation of the papers [Diffeomorphic Registration of Discrete Geometric Distributions](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789811200137_0003) and [Metrics, quantization and registration in varifold spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11196) by Hsi-Wei Hsieh and Nicolas Charon. The package provides tools to register, intepolate and compress geometrical shapes (such as point clouds, discrete cruves or triangulated surfaces) being represented as ***discrete varifolds*** based on ***LDDMM*** framework with ***kernel varifold distances***. Here's an example of amygdala surfaces matching example.
